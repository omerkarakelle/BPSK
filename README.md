# bpsk_modulation

MATLAB Implementation of BPSK Modulation.

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is a two phase modulation, where the 0’s and 1’s in a binary data are represented by two different phase states

In this implementation, a binary data is transformed into square waveform and then modulated. After modulation, a white Gaussian Noise is added to this signal. Finally, signal is demodulated and the program returns the output. The noise can be changed by changing the SNR value and signal energy Eb.
